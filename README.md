# Investigation on the Relationship Between Amount of Protein and Rating of Recipes

Authors: Vishal Rana & Akshay Uppal

## Overview

This data science project, conducted at UCSD, focus on exploring the relationship between the rating of a recipe and the proportion of sugar contributing to the total calories of the given recipe.

## Introduction

Food is a critical component of our daily lives, and cooking is a hobby that brings joy and satisfaction for many. While there are many of us who have a sweet tooth and love sugary food, the health risks associated with them, such as diabetes, are not negligible. According to the National Diabetes Statistics Report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 11.6% of the US population have diabetes and over 38.0% of people over 18 years old have prediabetes. With this information in our mind, we want to investigate the relationship between rating and the amount of sugar present in the recipe. **We wonder if people would rate a sugary recipe lower due to the health concerns relating to it**. To do so, we are analyzing two dataset consisting of recipes and ratings posted since 2008 on [food.com](https://www.food.com/). The original purpose of the datasets is for the recommender system research paper, [Generating Personalized Recipes from Historical User Preferences](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/emnlp19c.pdf) by Majumder et al.

The first dataset, `recipe`, contains 83782 rows, indicating 83782 unique recipes, with 10 columns recording the following information:

| Column             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `'nutrition'`      | Nutrition information in the form [calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]; PDV stands for “percentage of daily value” |
| `'n_steps'`        | Number of steps in recipe                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `'steps'`          | Text for recipe steps, in order                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `'description'`    | User-provided description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `'ingredients'`    | Text for recipe ingredients                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `'n_ingredients'`  | Number of ingredients in recipe                                                                                                                                                                   |

The second dataset, `interactions`, contains 731927 rows and each row contains a review from the user on a specific recipe. The columns it includes are:

| Column        | Description         |
| :------------ | :------------------ |
| `'user_id'`   | User ID             |
| `'recipe_id'` | Recipe ID           |
| `'date'`      | Date of interaction |
| `'rating'`    | Rating given        |
| `'review'`    | Review text         |

**Given the datasets, we are investigating whether people rate sugary recipes and the non-sugary recipes on the same scale.** To facilitate the investigation of our question, we separated the values in the `'nutrition'` columns into the corresponding columns,`'calories (#)'`, `'total fat (PDV)'`, `'sugar (PDV)'`, etc. PDV, or percent daily value shows how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a total daily diet. Moreover, we calculated the proportion of sugar in terms of calories out of the total calories of a given recipe and stored the information in a new column, `'prop_sugar'`. because sugary in here will be referring to the recipes with value `'prop_sugar'` higher than the average `'prop_sugar'`. The most relevant columns to answer our question are `'calories(#)'`, `'sugar (PDV)'`, `'prop_sugar'`, described above, `'rating'`, which is the rating that user gave on a recipe, and `'average rating'`, which are the average of the ratings on each unique recipes.

By seeking an answer to our question, we would have an insight on people’s preference on sugary recipes, which could help contributors on Food.com revise and improve their recipes to align with the public’s interests. In addition, the new pieces of information could lead to future work on diving deeper into how much awareness people have on the negative health effects of sweets.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

To make our analysis of the dataset more efficient and convenient, we conducted the following data cleaning steps.

1. Left merge the recipes and interactions datasets on id and recipe_id.

   - This step helps match the unique recipes with their rating and review.

1. Check data types of all the columns.

   - This step helps us evaluate what data cleaning steps are appropriate for the dataset and if we need to conduct data type conversion.
   - | Column             | Description |
     | :----------------- | :---------- |
     | `'name'`           | object      |
     | `'id'`             | int64       |
     | `'minutes'`        | int64       |
     | `'contributor_id'` | int64       |
     | `'submitted'`      | object      |
     | `'tags'`           | object      |
     | `'nutrition'`      | object      |
     | `'n_steps'`        | int64       |
     | `'steps'`          | object      |
     | `'description'`    | object      |
     | `'ingredients'`    | object      |
     | `'n_ingredients'`  | int64       |
     | `'user_id'`        | float64     |
     | `'recipe_id'`      | float64     |
     | `'date'`           | object      |
     | `'rating'`         | float64     |
     | `'review'`         | object      |

1. Fill all ratings of 0 with np.nan.

   - Rating is generally on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 meaning the lowest rating while 5 means the highest rating. With that being said, a rating of 0 indicates missing values in rating. Thus, to avoid bias in the ratings, we filled the value 0 with np.nan.

1. Add column `'average_rating'` containing average rating per recipe.

   - Since a recipe can have numerous ratings from different users, we take an average of all the ratings to get a more comprehensive understanding of the rating of a given recipe.

1. Split values in the nutrition column to individual columns of floats.

   - Even though the values in the nutrition column look like a list, they are actually objects, which act like strings. Given by the description of the columns of the recipe dataset, we know what each individual values inside the brackets mean. To split up the values, we applied a lambda function then converted the columns to floats. It will allow us to conduct numerical calculations on the columns.

1. Convert submitted and date to datetime.

   - These two columns are both stored as objects initially, so we converted them into datetime to allow us conduct analysis on trends over time if needed.

1. Add `'is_dessert'` to the dataframe

   - `'is_dessert'` is a boolean column checking if the tags of recipes contain 'dessert' since desserts typically have a higher amount of sugar. This step separates the recipes into two groups, ones that are dessert and ones that are not. This provides us another way to compare ratings of recipes with more sugar and ones with less sugar.

1. Add `'prop_sugar'` to the dataframe
   - prop_sugar is the proportion of sugar of the total calories in a recipe. To calculate this, we use the values in the sugar (PDV) column to divide by 100% to get it in the decimal form. Then, we multiply by 25 to convert the values to grams of sugar since 25 grams of sugar is the 100% daily value (PDV). We got this value of 25 grams from experimenting on food.com with different amounts of sugar in a recipe. The experimentation allows us to understand the nutrition formula used on the website for recipes. Lastly, we multiply by 4 since there are 4 calories in 1 gram of sugar. After all these conversions, we end up with the number of calories of sugar, so we can divide by the total amount of calories in the recipe to get the proportion of sugar of the total calories. This data cleaning step is critical to allow us to make parallel comparisons on the amount of sugar in a recipe without concerns of extremely large values since all the values will be between 0 and 1.
